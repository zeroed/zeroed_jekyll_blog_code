## The reading list

Here is the list for the 2015&#46;&#46;&#46;

I should probably say some words (maybe some numbers) about the list of the 
2014&#46;&#46;&#46; I'll think about it.

### January
- Nassim Nicholas Taleb - The Black Swan (2nd edition) : [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Swan_%282007_book%29)
